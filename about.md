I'm Katie and I'm a Level 3 Forest School Leader. I'm a
qualified teacher, and have worked with children of all age
groups. I've also volunteered extensively with Guiding and Scouting
groups, both in the UK and Sweden. I lived in Sweden for 5 years where
I was inspired by their approach to 'friluftsliv', or outdoor
living. I subscribe to the Swedish philosophy that there's 'no such
thing as bad weather, only bad clothing!'

I hold a Forest School First Aid certificate, am DBS cleared, and have
public liability insurance to carry out Forest School sessions. Copies
of these documents can be viewed on request.

## Current projects

Here is a taste of what we've got going on at the moment:

* Our [Little Explorers](little-explorers.html) forest play group takes place on Mondays, 10.00-11.30, at Poverest Park Orpington.

* We have recently launched Forest Fridays, a woodland exploration session at a private nursery in Bromley.

* I assist on [Forest School training courses](https://thehive-kids.com/pages/forest-school-training) with [The Hive Kids](https://thehive-kids.com/pages/concept-and-curriculum), as well as facilitating holiday missions for primary age children.

* I'm employed by Kent County Council as an Activity Ranger for [birthday parties](https://www.kent.gov.uk/leisure-and-community/kent-country-parks/birthday-parties) and other outdoor sessions.

* I help at [Muddy Boots](https://www.facebook.com/muddybootsfs/) who run monthly sessions and birthday parties. 

We're always on the look out for new projects and opportunities, so if you know of a school or childcare setting looking to introduce or develop Forest School or outdoor learning, do [get in touch](mailto:wildberrywoodlearning@gmail.com).
