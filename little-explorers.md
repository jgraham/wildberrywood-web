Little Explorers is a Forest School style group for toddlers and preschool children
and their carers. We read stories, sing songs, do nature based
activities, and have plenty of time for free play in the woods.

**Little Explorers is currently suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak.** For some activities to do with your children at this time, please see our [blog](blog.html).
