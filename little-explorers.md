Little Explorers is a Forest School style group for preschool children
and their carers. We read stories, sing songs, do nature based
activities, and have plenty of time for free play in the woods.

## When?

Monday mornings, 10am-11.30am

Spring term will run from 18th March 2019

## Where? 

Covert Woods, Poverest Park, Orpington.

Poverest Park is a short walk from Orpington town centre. The nearest
bus stop is Perry Hall School (stop P, route 61) and the car park is
accessed via Footbury Hill Rd, Orpington BR6 2SX.

Our meeting point is the fallen tree on the far
side of the football pitch, opposite the blue football pavilion.

## Why?

There is a growing body of research that shows that everyone, young
and old, benefits from contact with nature. It relieves stress, makes
us more mindful, and creates confident, well-rounded young people. We
also believe that it's important to encourage children to respect
nature, so that they will want to protect it for the future. It's also lots of fun! 

## What will my child need to wear?
Sessions will take place in all weathers (except thunderstorms
  and high winds, for safety reasons) so please dress your child (and
  yourself!) appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets
  and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can
  be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the
  ground. We strongly recommend wearing long sleeves and trousers in all weathers to avoid scratches and biting insects (it is also often cooler in the woods than it feels outside). If you have any questions about suitable clothing, or would like to find out if we have any second hand kit in your size, please send us an [email](mailto:wildberrywoodlearning@gmail.com). Similarly if your child has grown out of their kit and you would like to donate it, we will see that it gets used! 

## Please note
These sessions are for preschool children accompanied by a 
  parent, grandparent, childminder or other carer. We are in a public
  space, and whilst efforts are made to check for hazards, it's
  important that you keep your child under supervision at all
  times. Please report any hazards found to the session leader. Other people, especially dog walkers, use the area, so please
  be mindful of this. 
Please respect the site. We have permission to use the woods from Bromley council, but that permission can be withdrawn if they think we are damaging the woodland habitat. Please avoid trampling flowers and pulling leaves and twigs off trees. Please don’t drop any litter.

## We look forward to exploring with you!
