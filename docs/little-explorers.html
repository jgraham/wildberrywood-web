        <h2>Little Explorers</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Little Explorers is a Forest School style group for preschool children
and their carers. We read stories, sing songs, do nature based
activties, and crucially, have time for free play in the woods.</p>
<h2>Where?</h2>
<p>Covert Woods, Poverest Park, Orpington. The car park is accessed via
Footbury Hill Rd, Orpington BR6 2SX. Poverest Park is a short walk
from Orpington town centre. The nearest bus stop is Perry Hall School
(stop P, route 61). Click here for a map of the park. Our meeting
point is the fallen tree on the far side of the football pitch,
opposite the blue football pavilion.</p>
<h2>When?</h2>
<p>Monday mornings, 10am-11.30</p>
<h2>How much?</h2>
<p>Â£5 per child, no charge of parents/carers. Take advantage of our term
card discount by paying in advance for 5 sessions and receive your
sixth session free! Click here for more information.</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>There is a growing body of research that shows that everyone, young
and old, benefits from contact with nature. It relieves stress, makes
us more mindfull, and creates confident, well-rounded young people. We
also believe that it's important to encourage children to respect
nature, so that they will want to protect it for the future.</p>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<dl>
  <dt>Can I drop my child off?</dt>
  <dd>No. These sessions are for preschool children and their
  parents/grandparents/childminders/other carers. We are in a public
  space, and whilst efforts are made to check for hazards, it's
  important that you keep your child under supervision at all
  times. Other people, especially dog walkers, use the area, so please
  be mindful of this.</dd>
  <dt>What will my child need to wear?</dt>
  <dd>Sessions will take place in all weathers (except thunderstorms
  and high winds, for safety reasons) so please dress your child (and
  yourself!) appropriately. It is wise to layer up. Waterproof jackets
  and boots are essential, and waterproof trousers or puddle suits can
  be useful even if it is not wet, as children like to sit on the
  ground. Please wear long sleeves and trousers even in warm weather
  as there may be brambles and biting insects.</dd>
